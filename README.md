## Introduction

PRBench is a comprehensive web-based benchmark for evaluating probabilistic robustness (PR) and adversarial robustness (AR) of deep learning models across a range of training methods. It provides interactive leaderboards, performance tables, and visualizations to compare various methods on standardized datasets and perturbation settings.

## Features

- **Interactive Leaderboards**: Filter by dataset, model, and method.  
- **Performance Tables**: Metrics including clean accuracy, AR (PGD/C&W/Auto-Attack), PR, ProbAcc, generalization errors, and training time.  
- **Line Charts**: Dynamic PR, ProbAcc, and GEPR plots across perturbation radii.  
- **Composite Summary**: Aggregated robustness scores over all datasets and architectures.  
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using Bootstrap and custom CSS.  
- **Static & Easy to Deploy**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no backend required.

**Probabilistic Robustness Benchmark**

PRBench is the first comprehensive, web-based benchmark for evaluating probabilistic robustness (PR) and adversarial robustness (AR) of deep learning models under a variety of perturbation types and magnitudes. It provides interactive leaderboards, performance tables, and charts to help you compare training methods across datasets, architectures, and robustness metrics.
